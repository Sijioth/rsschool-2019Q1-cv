## Summary: ##
I consider myself as honest person and I'm highly motivated to make programming my lifetime project. 
I feel that it’s my place to be. And I’ll do my best (and more) to reach it.  
There are some reasons for it, I’ll try to point out the mains:  
* **Love and passion.** When you start your first self-written application and see it’s working... Good Lord, if you feel butterflies in your chest have the desire to scream “It’s alive” at the moment – than you definitely understand what I’m talking about. Let’s say, it’s worth sitting tens of hours at the monitor without any interruptions.  
* **Constant progress.** I came to the idea that “If you don’t progress, your state becomes stagnation and then slide down into regress”.  
* **Community.** One could meet interesting and remarkable people during the job. Such acquaintances could inspire to grow, to become a better version of you. And then you could help others to grow. It evolves into a circle of constant progress. And it’s really amazing.  
* **Salary.** One guy said on his youtube-channel that “programmers are the modern knights”. They do constant training, working hard to move many aspects of life forward and they deserve better conditions of life. And I agreed with this opinion. To be honest, it’s not only reason to do the job, but definitely not the last.

## Projects & Code Examples: ##
One of the tasks at my present job is to write and maintain the application to decode files with binary sequences (which are the result of the lifecycle of the real device) into readable audit logs. And I’ve done it in Java with use of custom side-connected dictionary. That was made to ease the maintain of my app through device versions, because the application core logic would change less often.  

Another one project is maintaining and enhancing the CPA-network ([https://www.cpainside.com](https://www.cpainside.com)) based on the platform written in PHP ([example](https://mastertraf.com)). My duties in the project are to handle all tech issues appearing during its lifecycle. To keep database up to date. To write code for different improvements and make code-logic fixes, for example: 
[webmaster-to-consultant auto-distribution script](https://pastebin.com/af9JKa9C), which works by following algorithm:
>at new webmaster registration check if there is a referral link 
>		-> if yes - pass the consultant id from it to a specified field in database table.
>		-> if no - get next free consultant’s id from special database table and pass it to specified field in another database table.
>				-> then get consultant’s e-mail from database and send notification with new webmaster’s contacts in it.

[auto-send notification to webmaster's consultant after webmaster's account activation](https://pastebin.com/ddWhJL4e).
